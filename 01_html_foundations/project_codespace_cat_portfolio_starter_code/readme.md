# Presentation
I am Mateo Benzien.  I have matriculated from Fairbairn College during 2023.

The mame of my pro9ject is : Profile of Cats.

The goal of my project is to test my knowledge and und3erstanding of HTML and highlight any possible shortcomings.

I have included images of cats, which I have used as thumbnails, as provided in the course material.

I have also used a hyperlink of a revied on codespace academy.

I have included a form where you can contact me via e-mail.

My lay-out page consists of :  The title and Sections that contain information about me, such as my skills, portfolia and my contact information.

HTML-tages I have used, are Hyperlinks and e-mail.  I have used hyperlinks for easy navigation and e-mail for contact purposes.

The hyperlinks are for quick and easy navigation to obtain information.  

The images and forms are used for thumbnails of the cats and the form for the e-mail.

I found coding the images and using the hyperlinks challenging at first, but got the hang of it. I had the wrong code for the images initially and forgot to insert the # in the code for the hyperlink.

I have presented how to make a website using HTML.
